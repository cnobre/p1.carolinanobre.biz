         <h3>About Me</h3>
         <p>Originally from Brazil, I moved to the US in 2008 to get my master's degree in Oceanography. While doing so, I fell in love with country music, became a vegetarian, and realized my true passion lies in programming and computer science.</p><br/>

         <h3>My Job</h3>
         <p>After earning my degree I had a brief stint at a company making current predictions for  oil and gas companies. Today I work in the physical oceanography deptartment at WHOI (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) processing data and writing software for data acquired on the cruises.</p>

         <h3>If I had to do it over...</h3>
         <p>Definitely would have gone to undergrad in Computer Science, or perhaps Photography. Although I must say that Oceanography has allowed me to travel more than I ever would have in a CS career. Over the past 2 years I have been to the Arctic, Norway, Bermuda, Turkey, Iceland...</p>
